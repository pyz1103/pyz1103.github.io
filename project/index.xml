      <title>Game Analysis and Decision Making research on pedestrian and Vehicle Traffic Conflict in Unsignalized Road Sections</title>

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve the problem of pedestrian-vehicle traffic conflict in unsignalized road sections, Cumulative-prospect-based
Multiparty Conflict Game (CPMCG) was constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles, it is found that conformity effect has a great
influence on pedestriansâ€™ decision-making, which is introduced into the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is found that the system can form four different evolution results, and the risk cost, conformity effect and other
parameters have their own influence on the results.

      <title>Simulation and Optimization Design of Passenger Distribution Behavior of Road Passenger Stations</title>

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of mustering and evacuation of passengers and traffic characteristics in road passenger terminals
are quantitatively analyzed to provide parameter support for pedestrian simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massmotion software is used to simulate passenger terminals and find bottleneck points of traffic flow in stations by
analyzing pedestrian indicators such as flow, per capita density and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimization measures were put forward to improve the service capacity of functional areas by 41.20 %, increase
the walking speed by 9.01 %, and shorten the stay time of passengers by 30.44 %.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
